# PandemicAirportOps

## Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the aviation industry, requiring new procedures and technologies for safe operation. This repository contains SQL scripts designed to track and manage airport operations data during this challenging period.

## Repository Contents
This project consists of the following SQL scripts:

1.  **`Anudeepsri_Bathina_AirportOperationsDB_DDL.sql`**
    *   Contains the Data Definition Language (DDL) statements.
    *   Creates the `AirPandemicOps` database.
    *   Defines tables such as `Country`, and presumably others for Flights, Passengers, etc.

2.  **`Anudeepsri_Bathina_Views_Triggers_SPs.sql`**
    *   Contains stored procedures, views, and triggers to manage and analyze the data.

## Usage
To set up the database:
1.  Run the DDL script (`Anudeepsri_Bathina_AirportOperationsDB_DDL.sql`) to create the database schema.
2.  Run the Objects script (`Anudeepsri_Bathina_Views_Triggers_SPs.sql`) to create the necessary database objects.

## Key Features
-   **Data Tracking**: Schedules, Passenger info, Aircraft movements, Security, and Weather.
-   **Automation**: Stored procedures to help automate operational tasks.
-   **Analysis**: Views designed to identify trends and improve efficiency during the pandemic.
